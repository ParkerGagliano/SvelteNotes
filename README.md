# Svelte Notes App

This is a simple notes app with login functionality and storage provided by the custom REST API I made using express found [Here](https://github.com/ParkerGagliano/DocsAPI)

## To run

`npm run dev`
This will work you will just need to run the [API](https://github.com/ParkerGagliano/DocsAPI) at the same time for it to work
You will just need to run 
```

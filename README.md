# Svelte Notes App
![Demo](https://github.com/ParkerGagliano/SvelteNotes/blob/main/public/demo.gif)

This is a simple notes app with login functionality and storage provided by the custom REST API I made using express found [Here](https://github.com/ParkerGagliano/DocsAPI)

## To run

`npm run dev`
After running `npm run dev` you just need to run the [API](https://github.com/ParkerGagliano/DocsAPI) at the same time for it to work

After getting the API you will just need to run 
```
node app.js
```
in order to run the API
